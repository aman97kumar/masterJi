# Books Library

## Live Deployment
Check out the live project at: [Books Library](https://master-ji-vp48.vercel.app/)

## Overview
Build a Book Library website using [FreeAPI.app](https://api.freeapi.app/) that fetches and displays book data dynamically in a user-friendly way. This project will help you practice working with API requests, handling JSON data, and rendering dynamic content using JavaScript.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Features
- Fetch books from the API and display them as a list/grid.
- Provide an option for the user to switch between the viewing types (list vs. grid).
- Show book details including title, author, publisher, published date, and thumbnail.
- Implement a search bar to filter books by title or author.
- Implement a sort feature to list books in:
  - Alphabetical order based on their title.
  - Date of release (publishedDate).
- Implement pagination to fetch the next set of details upon reaching the end of the page.
- Clicking on a book item should open more details in a new tab (using `infoLink`).
